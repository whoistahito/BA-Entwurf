\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis presented a novel, open-source approach to job matching that addresses the semantic limitations of traditional keyword-based search engines and the opacity of industrial recommendation systems. By integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-based requirements extraction with an embedding-driven similarity search, the proposed system demonstrates a viable path toward more transparent and semantically grounded job retrieval.

    \item \textbf{Readiness for Automation}: While Qwen3-8B achieved the top rank, the absolute scores (hovering around 0.5-0.6) and low pass rates (<30\% for strict correctness) indicate that 8B-parameter models are not yet fully reliable for fully autonomous, unsupervised extraction. They require either human-in-the-loop verification or further fine-tuning to reach production-grade reliability.

\section{Outlook}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Thinking models are not considered, Data Processing was not perfect (data imbalance),
\item bigger models,
\item  Readability metric for evaluation was not so effective, because the for exception handling it retuned an empty object, so there were no output that had syntax errors.
    \item How fast the whole process is has not been measured.
    \item add explaining ability of the system, that shows why a job is relevant to a user profile.
